Although a traditional subject in classical statistics, you can also consider Regression from a machine learning point of view. You'll learn more about the predictive capabilities and performance of regression algorithms. At the end of this chapter you'll be acquainted with simple linear regression, multi-linear regression. So let's take the first step into Machine Learning Algorithms

## Project 
Iowa Dataset

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this dataset will help you determine aspects which influence price of a property other than sq.ft. area and locality. 

Make your first prediction with our favourite ML algorithm!
