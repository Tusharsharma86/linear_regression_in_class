*    A. 1
*    B. Value of *slope* parameter
*    C. Value of *intercept* parameter
*    D. Impossible to estimate

**Answer:** B. Value of *slope* parameter

*    B. zero
*    C. positive 0.15
*    D. positive 1.5
*    E. negative .05

**Answer:** D. positive 1.5

#### 3) A regression analysis is inappropriate when

*    A. you have two variables that are measured on an interval or ratio scale. 
*    B. you want to make predictions for one variable based on information about another variable. 
*    C. the pattern of data points form a reasonably straight line. 
*    D. there is heteroscedasticity in the scatter plot. 

**Answer:** A. you have two variables that are measured on an interval or ratio scale

#### 4) If a case has a high residual statistic, what does this suggest about the accuracy of the model for predicting that caseâ€™s score on the outcome measure?

*    A. Nothing, the residual statistic is not relevant 
*    B. The outcome for the case is accurately predicted by the model 
*    C. The outcome for the case is poorly predicted by the model 
*    D. The case is statistically significant

**Answer:** C. The outcome for the case is poorly predicted by the model

#### 5) How do you know that your linear model was a wise choice (the linear model is the correct model)?

*    A. When I flip a coin and it lands heads up.
*    B. When I have run out of other models to try.
*    C. When the r^2 value is close to 1.
*    D. When the graph of the residuals(x, y - y-hat)forms a straight line.
*    E. When the residuals(x, y - y-hat)are small and scattered(no pattern).
    
**Answer:** E. When the residuals(x, y - y-hat)are small and scattered(no pattern)

#### 6) When do you know that the model is a close fit to the data?
    
*    A. When I flip a coin and it lands heads up.
*    B. When I have run out of other models to try.
*    C. When the r^2 value is close to 1.
*    D. When the graph of the residuals(x, y - y-hat)forms a straight line.
*    E. When the residuals(x, y - y-hat)are small and scattered(no pattern).
    
**Answer:** C. When the r^2 value is close to 1.

#### 7) When is the relationship between x and y too strong to assume that the slope of the best fit line (Beta) is possibly zero?

*    A. When the confidence interval for the slope does not contain the value 0.
*    B. When the p value of the linear regression t-test is very small.
*    C. When the residuals are small and scattered.
*    D. When the r^2 value is close to 1 
*    E. Answers A or B will suffice.

**Answer:** E. Answers A or B will suffice.

#### 8) Changing the units of measurement of the Y variable will affect all but which one of the following?

*    A. the estimated intercept parameter
*    B. the estimated slope parameter
*    C. the Total Sum of Squares for the regression
*    D. R squared for the regression
*    E. the estimated standard errors
    
**Answer:** D. R squared for the regression

#### 9) The least squares estimator of the slope coefficient is unbiased means

*    A. the estimated slope coefficient will always be equal to the true parameter value
*    B. the estimated slope coefficient will get closer to the true parameter value as the size of the sample increases
*    C. the estimated slope coefficient will be equal to the true parameter if the sample is large
*    D. the mean of the sampling distribution of the slope parameter is zero
*    E. if repeated samples of the same size are taken, on average their value will be equal to the true parameter
    
**Answer:** E.

#### 10) In a simple linear regression model the slope coefficient measures

*    A. the elasticity of Y with respect to X
*    B. the change in Y which the model predicts for a unit change in X
*    C. the change in X which the model predicts for a unit change in Y
*    D. the ratio Y/X
*    E. the value of Y for any given value of X

**Answer:** B
